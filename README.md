# image_similarity
A side project for demo purposes for Udacity's Pytorch challenge course. Its a work in progress

The code depends upon very large model, captions and Embedding files (of the order of 25GB or more) that I have created locally for testing and validation. These files are not suitable for uploading on Git-Hub.
In order to create them, it takes several hours on full dataset.
I have included this README since it was a requirement for the project submission form. However, the actual code and run commands shall be available soon.

For the time being, you can view the Jupyter Notebook and the .py file to get a good idea of the code.
A simple demo of the code can be found at: https://youtu.be/1ydUGKREA8Y


The code is a work in progress as of now. I am working on it with one of my local colleagues. We are still in the process of creating and structuring our class hierarchy properly. A lot of refactoring and code addition is going on. I will be making updates to Git-repository in near future.
